## Project

Create a data-only play space which allows a ball to bounce around.

----

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
  
- No graphics.
- No sounds.
- No inputs.

### Design Constraints

- User must read output of terminal to observe state of the simulation.
- Ball may only bounce off of the walls.
- There are no paddles.
- There is no visual or auditory feedback.

### Implementation Constraints

- A play field shall exist.
- Field shall be represented as an integer based grid.
- Field shall have two types of tiles:
  - "reflective"
  - "transparent"
- A ball shall exist.
  - Ball will begin at center stage.
  - Ball will be given a random vector.
  - Ball will travel along the vector until it hits a "reflective tile".
- "reflective" tiles have two features:
  - A direction, or normal.
  - Affect the vector of the ball `vectorNew = -2 * (inVector dot wallNormal) * wallNormal + inVector`.

### Completion Requirements

- [ ] Data structure representing the play field.
- [ ] Algorithms to simulate a ball moving around the field in accordance to the design of Pong.
- CLI outputs the following textual feedback:
  - [ ] "The ball has spawned at [x,y], with a vector of [x,y]"
  - [ ] "The ball has bounced off of the wall at [x,y], with a vector of [x,y]"
